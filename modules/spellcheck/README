This is a Textadept module for spell checking. Install it in your
`~/.textadept/modules/` directory and load it from your `~/.textadept/init.lua`:

    _M.spellcheck = require('spellcheck')

By default the `F7` key starts interactive spell check and `Shift+F7` marks all
misspelled words in the buffer. If you prefer to use the mouse, left-clicking on
misspelled words will display suggestions. There is also a submenu in the
"Tools" menu for spell checking.

Textadept attempts to load a preexisting Hunspell dictionary for the detected
locale. If none exists, or if the locale is not detected, Textadept falls back
on its own prepackaged US English dictionary. You can change this by altering
the `_M.spellcheck.spellchecker` field with one returned from
`_M.spellcheck.spell()`. Please see `spell.luadoc` for more information on that
function.

User dictionaries are located in the `~/.textadept/dictionaries/` directory, and
Textadept will load any dictionary file in that directory automatically.
Dictionary files are Hunspell dictionaries and follow the Hunspell format: the
first line contains the number of entries in the dictionary followed by one word
per line.

By default, Textadept will only check the spelling of words in plain text,
comments, and strings. You can expand this by altering the
`_M.spellcheck.spellcheckable_styles` table.

Also by default, Textadept spell checks the buffer each time it is saved,
highlighting any misspelled words. The `_M.spellcheck.check_spelling_on_save`
option controls this behavior.

For utilizing spell check via Lua API, please see the `spell.luadoc` and
`spellchecker.luadoc` files.
